 * us), the local edits the user JUST made must not be discarded. The old
 * behaviour fetched the fresh cloud row and overwrote localStorage with it
 * wholesale — silently destroying, e.g., a watchlist the user typed seconds
 * earlier. This merge resolves the conflict without data loss:
 *
 *   - Start from the fresh cloud blob (so a concurrent change from another
 *     device survives).
 *   - Overlay the keys the user changed locally since the last clean upload
 *     (`dirtyKeys`): a dirty key present in `localBlob` → the local value
 *     wins; a dirty key ABSENT from `localBlob` → the user removed it
 *     locally → drop it from the merge so the removal sticks.
 *
 * Pure function — no I/O. `cloudData` is the migrated cloud blob, `localBlob`
 * is the current localStorage snapshot, `dirtyKeys` is the set of sync keys
 * mutated locally since the last clean upload. Extracted here (not in
 * cloud-prefs-sync.ts) so it stays unit-testable without the sync runtime.

 * equals the current local value (`localBlob`). Absence counts as null on

 * check and is NOT returned — it stays dirty for the next upload.

 * Schema 2 (2026-05-01): one-shot recovery for the v1 free-tier source-cap
 * bug. The pre-PR-3521 alphabetical-slice cap auto-disabled every source
 * past position 80 alphabetically, leaving entire late-alphabet categories
 * (Layoffs, Semiconductors, IPO, Funding, Product Hunt, …) with 100% of
 * their feeds in `disabledFeeds`. PR #3521 added a per-origin localStorage
 * migration to recover this, but cloud-prefs sync re-poisoned origins
 * every load by overwriting localStorage with the still-bad cloud blob —
 * the recovery had to live at the cloud-data layer to be permanent.
 *
 * This migration runs ONCE per cloud row (gated by schemaVersion < 2),
 * detects categories where 100% of sources are in `disabledFeeds`, and
 * re-enables them. After the migration completes, schemaVersion bumps to
 * 2 and subsequent sync pulls skip recovery — so a user who explicitly
 * disables every source in a category POST-migration keeps that
 * preference forever. The 100%-disabled-category heuristic is targeted
 * enough that explicit single-source disabling is preserved.
 *
 * The recovery uses the variant-aware FEEDS passed in by the caller; the
 * cloud blob is variant-scoped (per /api/user-prefs?variant=...) so the
 * caller-supplied FEEDS already matches the row's variant.
